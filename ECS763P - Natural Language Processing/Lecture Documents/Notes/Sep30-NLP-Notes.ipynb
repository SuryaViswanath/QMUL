    "As the saying goes, `With great power comes great responsibility`, Lets give it a new form in the case of NLP -> `With great solution comes, great problems.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving a language problem comes with it's own challenges for ex: \n",
    "1. **Inconsistent use of words** - varying usage of words\n",
    "   <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",

    "4. **Tokenization** - Tokenization is an important step during data preprocessing as it helps the model understand the data much better. However, what you need to understand here is there are a lot of nuances. These nuances will be covered just in a little while.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Normalization** - In simple terms, it is making sense of what is given. There are two different types at a high level:\n",
    "   - Symmetric normalization\n",
